DESCRIPTION: 
This project was done for a campaign landing page at work for NZME.co.nz. 
It was initially centred around the content that went out across their brands for the Cricket World Cup in 2015. It pulled three feeds from nzherald.co.nz, radiosport.co.nz and theacc.co.nz.
I have updated this however to only include a single feed from Radio Sport and have changed the theme to Rugby instead as some of the original feeds used no longer exist.

USING:
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Boostrap and Font Awesome Icons.
* Displays feed content using Google's Feed API: https://developers.google.com/feed/v1/devguide
